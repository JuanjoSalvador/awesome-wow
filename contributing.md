## The Basics

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Use the following format: 

      [Bookmark Title](link) - *Description*.
    
* The title usually consists of several words. For bookmarks of an article or tutorial, use the title of the article.
* The description consists of one-two sentences about the bookmark. It is required.
* Titles should be capitalized.
* Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
* New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Thank you for your suggestions!

Introducing the use of badges. Sometimes there is deprecated resources that are still recommended for some reason, for example, to understand some base concepts.
If you want to add something that is deprecated, make sure to add the `deprecated` badge at the end of the line.

In the same way, if there are one or more deprecated resources in one category, and you want to update them for some reason, make sure to
remove the red bad and add the green one.
